Chess-Openings
==============

My goal is to create a tree of all chess openings and show how they are connected. I use the ECO codes to organize the openings.

I have created a dot file while is compiled using the command:

dot -Tsvg chess.dot -o chess.svg
(If you want it in some other format just switch the svg to png or pdf)

This is my initial attempt. If there is a better organizational method, let me know! Also, I don't want these openings to be just limited to these ECO codes, I would like to go beyond with more variations.
